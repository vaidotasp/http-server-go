This is a starting point for Go solutions to the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

This is a simple HTTP server implementation in Go with a very limited feature set and limited test cases. Project started as Codecrafters challenge and is tweaked to include test cases and some additional functionality.

- parsing Headers
- creating and reading files
- echoing out requests
- utilizing gzip encoding
